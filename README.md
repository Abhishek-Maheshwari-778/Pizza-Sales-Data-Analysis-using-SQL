# 🍕 Pizza Sales Data Analysis using SQL

> 🔍 A self-learned data analytics project based on real-world pizza sales data

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive **SQL-based analysis** of a pizza sales dataset.  
Using structured queries, I explored and extracted insights related to:

- Total orders and revenue
- Popular pizzas and sizes
- Sales patterns by time and category
- Revenue-based performance

The project is structured into **three difficulty levels**: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced — each with real business-driven questions, SQL queries, and outputs.

## 🗃️ Dataset Structure

The dataset includes the following 4 relational tables:

| Table Name      | Description                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `orders`         | Order ID, date, and time                   |
| `order_details`  | Order ID, pizza ID, quantity               |
| `pizzas`         | Pizza ID, size, and price                  |
| `pizza_types`    | Pizza name, category, ingredients          |
